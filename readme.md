# Introduction

This is an library for playing files on the DFPlayer module.

You can read a little about it here https://www.dingus.dk/dfplayer-mp3wav-lydmodul/ (Note it is in danish)

This library was made for a project (Not yet published) where I connect the DFPlayer module to an IHC controller using my ArduinoIHC library
